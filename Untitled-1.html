    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>I am Reese Shackelford, a junior attending Clovis West High School and CART(Center of Advanced Research and Technology). I plan to pursue a career in visual development or game development.
        I plan to attend community college then transfer to a university. Between now and then I want to finish this year and next year with a 4.0 GPA. I became interested in visual development because of my love of designing characters and settings. 
        Currently I spend most of my time drawing. I attend the Web Application Development lab at CART to learn how to code. Although I would prefer to do the visual part of game development, I donâ€™t find being on the technical side. I have also taken two years of art classes and an art history class at Clovis West.
        Outside of school I work at Trelio as a dishwasher. There I practice teamwork skills as I work with four other people.
