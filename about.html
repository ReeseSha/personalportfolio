    <h3>About</h3> 

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p> Art and music are two of the hobbies I do the most. I have been drawing for as long as I can remember and I consider it to be one of the things I am good at. I am currently working on improving my naturalism on a digital medium.
        I started music with the violin in the 5th grade and played it in my school orchestra to my sophomore year. I also taught myself electric guitar, piano, ukulele, ocarina, and accordion.
    </p>
    <h2>Four Year Plan</h2>
    <p>	My plan for the next 4 years is to graduate with good grades, then go to a community college for two years. After I want to transfer to a university to focus on what career field I choose.
