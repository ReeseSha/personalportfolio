        <P> I have done many projects this past year. Here I have chosen a select few to show my range and skill.
        </P>
        <p>
            The first project I have chosen to share is creating a calculator. For this assignment, we had to program a functioning calculator using Javascript. This was the first major project on the subject, it taught me the basics with programming and the ability to plan efficiently. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The second project was the choose your own adventure story. We had to write our own story, plan the choices and endings, then use javascript to put everything together. Me and my partner had to plan how the buttons for the choices would work and how to have the choices lead to a specific ending. We ended up putting all of the choices into an array that linked to the endings. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The third project was the digital board game. For this assignment we had to choose a board game and use Javascript to make it digital. My partner and I chose the game battleship with a twist, the twist was neither player can see their own ships and it all takes place on one board. This project was the most challenging in my opinion, we weren't able to finish on time, but we made decent progress.
